# nanoDNS

A *copy* of the worlds smallest useful DNS server.  The code was originally from: http://maradns.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/nanodns-updated.html

I've added a makefile, and will use the code on my Raspberry Pi... so that any domain name entered into a browser can be resolved back to the Raspberry Pi's own site.
